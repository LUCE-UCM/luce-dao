# LUCE-DAO

This is a React dapp that uses Web3 and MetaMask to store and verify UCM student participation in out-of-class activities through connecting, verifying and transacting with a smart contract deployed to the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet. 

The [tool](https://luce-ucm.github.io/luce-dao-app/) has been deployed to GitHub Pages.
